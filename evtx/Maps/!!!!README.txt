Map files are read in order, alphabetically. This means you can create your own alternative maps to the default by doing the following:

1. make a copy of the map you want to modify
2. name it the same as the map you are interested in, but prepend 1_ to the front of the filename.
3. edit the new map to meet your needs

Example:

4624.map is copied and renamed to:

1_4624.map

Edit 1_4624.map and make your changes

When the maps are loaded, since 1_4624.map comes before 4624.map, only the one with your changes will be loaded.

This also allows you to update default maps without having your customizations blown away every time there is an update.
